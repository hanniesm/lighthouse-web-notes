#Week Three
We're going to be making a webapp called Tweeter. Initially will use a static array, but eventually will have a MongoDB.

##Structure of HTML page

<!-- version of the html. Here it's HTML 5 -->
<!DOCTYPE html>

<!-- Specify the language of the page -->
<html lang="en">
<!-- <head> Meta information about the document -->
<head>
  <!-- Character set that the document is going to use -->
  <meta charset="UTF-8">

  <!-- Mobile. How this page is going to adapt to the screen  -->
  <meta name="vieport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

  <!-- Which version of IT is this page compatible with -->
  <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge">

  <!--Title appears when hover over page tab and in search results  -->
  <title>Document</title>
</head>

<!-- <body> content goes here -->
<body>
  <h1>This is my title. You should have only one h1 per page, because it makes search engine's life easier to know what the page is about</h1>

  <h6>This is an h6 title</h6>

  <p>Content goest in between an opening and closing tag. <strong>This</strong> is an important word on the page. More important than other words. While this is a <b>bold</b> word which is no more important than any other word on the page</p>

  <a href="http://www.google.ca">This is a link</a>

  <input type="text" name="" id="">

  <img src="path to image file" alt="description of the image which is important for screen readers and search engines">

  <br>

  <hr>


</body>
</html>


##Semantic tags
Introduced in html 5.

Should install emmit. Seems to be installed
<div></div> used to use divs to structure page. Now use semantic tags
- Header
- Nav
- Main
- Aside
- Footer
- Article
- Section

<header>
  <nav>
    <div class="logo">
    </div>
    <main>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="#">Menu1</a></li>
        <li><a href="#">Etc</a></li>
      </ul>
      <section id="semantic-tags">
        <article>
          <header>
            <h2>Header Tag</h2>
          </header>
          <p>
          </p>
          <footer>
            Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur
          </footer>
        </article>
      </section>
    </main>
  </nav>
</header>

##CSS (Cascading Style Sheet)
With CSS everything is using a box.

###Box Model
We can manipulate the properties on box model
- Padding
Space between the content and its border.

- Border
Assign a border around the content

- Margin
Space between elements

####Box Model example
<!DOCTYPE html>

<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="vieport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge">
  <title>Document</title>
</head>

<body>
  <h1>This is my title. You should have only one h1 per page, because it makes search engine's life easier to know what the page is about</h1>
  <h6>This is an h6 title</h6>
  <p>Content goest in between an opening and closing tag. <strong>This</strong> is an important word on the page. More important than other words. While this is a <b>bold</b> word which is no more important than any other word on the page</p>

  <a href="http://www.google.ca">This is a link</a>

</body>
</html>

Inspected. H1 does some margins by default.
border 1px solid.

Block level elements that can adjust:
- h1...h6
- div
- p
- li

Some of the elements are in-line elements, e.g. strong. These are not block level elements. You can't change the width etc on in-line elements. Padding with kind of work. Can still do border. But still tries to show in-line with the text. Can change an in-line element to an in-line block.

##CSS
Three ways to add style to page
1. Add in-line style, e.g. <main style="background-color: lightgray">
2. Specify style rules in head of document.
    <style>
      selector {
        property: value;
        property: value;
        ...
      }
    </style>

    <style>
      header {
        background-color: lightskyblue;
        color: darkolivegreen;
      }
      article {
        border: 4px solid pink;
        margin: 3em;
      }
    </style>

  Finds all the header tags in the HTML and applies style. Also applies to the children of the tag. Inline CSS will take prescendence over head level styling.
3. External stylesheet.
  Put styles in their own folder. styles.css.

  h1 {
    border: 2px solid slateblue;
    font-size: 2em;
    background-color: antiquewhite;
    padding: 1em;
    <!-- using em rather than px is better for adapting to small screens as it is relevant to the default size of the browser. Times 16; Can also use rem.  -->
  }

  Create link between html and the css.
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="./styles/styles.css">

##References
[Semantic HTML]
[Normalize.css - makes browsers render all elements more consistently and in line with modern standards.]

Good to develop your own stylesheets first so understand how they are applied, and then move to something like bootstrap.


###CSS Layout
- Floats, used in a lot of legacy code
- Flexbox/CSS Grid
- CSS Positioning
