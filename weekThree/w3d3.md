#AJAX
In traditional model had to reload the whole page. In AJAX model could update just the part you had changed.
Traditional model was synchronous - a blocking model. AJAX was asynchronous - non blocking model.
Before AJAX you could only do this thing with Flash, Javaaplet. What remained was an active XML request.
In code can use it with this XMLHttpRequest or AjaxRequest.

#Demo XMLHttpRequest
1) Create a new XMLHttp object

<!-- This URL is a fake JSON -->
const url = 'http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts'

<!-- Create a new XMLHttp object. Needs new keyword in front. New keyword makes it an object -->
const httpRequest = new XMLHttpRequest();

 <!-- error validation  -->
 if(!httpRequest) {
  console.log("Error, could not create request");
}

<!-- using onreadystatechange to handle the response -->
httpRequest.onreadystatechange = function () {
  if (httpRequest.readyState === XMLHttpRequest.DONE) {
    if (httpRequest.status === 200) {
      console.log(httpRequest.responseText);
    } else {
      console.log(`Error with the request, status code: ${httpRequest.status}`);
    }
  }
}

<!-- Create request -->
httpRequest.open('GET', url, true);

<!-- Send the request. Remains empty as it is a get not a post -->
httpRequest.send(null);
