#Intro to Ruby

##Difference between interpreted and compiled language
With C, C++ there is a compile phase. Compiler with parse your code and look for syntax errors. Will not produce an output until you fix all the errors.
From the compile you get a machine code program - .exe .dmg
In compiler need to define all the variables' types. E.g. nb is an integer.
Compiler languages will be very fast. Performant.
But is machine dependent. If compile code on my machine it's not guaranteed to work on yours. 

Interpreted - you write the code and then use an interpreter like node or ruby to run the code, which will output machine version and then output them line by line. If it encounters an error it will stop. 
Because it needs to go line by line it is slower.
More flexible - don't need to specify type of data up front. 
Can run on any machine. 
Can code in a more abstract way. 

Javascript is a compiled language, but it's a JIT (Just In Time) compiler. 

Java language - code once, run anywhere. It would translate Java into machine like language - not specific to one machine, which would be transformed into Bytecode. When install Java Runtime on machine it can execute the Bytecode.

##Why learn a new language
Different languages better for different purposes.
To learn how to learn a new language. 
Learn a new paradigm - way to code according to some principles (procedural, functional, OOP (Ruby)) OOP has been main paradigm for last 30 years. You can do OOP with Javascript but it's not enforced. Nor is it functional. WIth JS you can do imperative coding
OOP - base unit is the object. 
    Inheritance. 
    Abstraction. 
    Polymorphism - you can do action on object, depending on the nature of that object may be a different action. 
    Encapsulation - cannot access the state of the object - it's private.
    Allowed code reuse. 
Procedural - function that doesn't return a value. Procedural systems were so specific you couldn't reuse the code for another system.

Object has two parts
1) Data -> properties
2) Behaviours -> methods

The object is coming alive when call the New keyword. Each object is based off model/template/blueprint that call a class. Class is a data structure that is going to be a template for each object.

```ruby
class Computer  
  brand
  type
  processor
  color
  
  set Brand(brand)
  set Color(color)
  
  Turnon
  Turnoff
  
  get type

c1 = Computer.new("hp")
c2 = Computer.new("Apple")

```
Out of computer class will have different objects with the same structure, properites and methods. But internal data might differ. If want to access properties, cannot unless it has been allowed. E.g. there is no method to set the processor, so that information cannot be changed. 

In JS even if don't use getters and setters you can still change data in the object. In Ruby you cannot. 

Goal with OOP is to make code more maintainable and usable. 

Functional programming
Started using in the 70s. Remained in academic because it was slow. 
Now we have highly interactive systems, so have parallel programming etc. Even with OOP you are still doing a bit of imperative because you have to share the state.
Function should not produce side effects. Pure functions. No function should modify a global variable. Should not modify the original structure. Map function is a functional function - it doesn't modify the original array, it creates a new one. 
Code is declarative rather than imperative. Declarative code just states what the result should be, not how to do it.
Functions have a single purpose (singularity principle)
Function composition - output of one function is the input of the next one.

```js
const inventory = products
    .filter(product => product.category === "Electronics")
    .map(product => product.quantity * product.price)
    .reduce((total, next) => (total += next), 0);
```

Pascal, Closure, Elm are functional languages. They enforce functional programming.

###Javascript versus Ruby
Javascript was created in 1995 in 10 days by Brendon Eich of Netscape. Inspiration Lisp, Keen. Wanted to do a functional language in browser. Netscape was partnering with Sun who used Java, so they wanted Javascript to look more like Java. Was named Lightstrip in beginning. They wanted to take on the popularity of Java so they renamed it. That's why Javascript is a mix of C and Java. 
Javascript has primitive data types
Highly performant
Very flexible
Fairly good for rapid development
Asynchronous

Ruby created around the same time by Yukihiro Matsumoto (Matz) was designed for developer happiness and productivity. Took off with release of Ruby on Rails in 2005 (released by David Heinemeir Hansson from Basecamp). Mostly a OOP but can also do imperative programming and use FP concepts.
All the startups started using Ruby because it was so fast to start your app.
Everything in Ruby is an Object
Performance issues
Very opinionated
Even faster for rapid prototyping and development
Synchronous (less scalable)
Very legible code
Develop a high-quality web site rapidly
very good database functionality (ActiveRecord)
Lots of abstraction

##Let's look at some Ruby
Hash - like an object in Javascript. 
Single quotes/Double quotes - there is a difference. With single quotes it will take special characters as a literal character. 

````ruby
name = "Max"
"Hello my name is #{name}"

````
There are a lot of methods built into the language to deal with arrays. Look at the class array in Ruby documentation.
If see question mark on a method will return a boolean. 

````ruby
characters = ["Bob", "Mario", "Peach"]
characters.first
characters.last
characters[1]

characters.reverse
characters.shuffle

#This does not change the original array. If want to change original array need to add an exclamation mark (a bang) to direction.

characters.rotate
characters.size
characters.count
characters.sample

#You pass callbacks as blocks { ... }

numbers = [6, 9, 4, 2, 6]

triples = numbers.map{|nb| * 3}
#=> 18, 27, 12, 6, 18
#Ruby does implicit returns. The last line in block of code is returned. 
triples = numbers.map.with_index{|nb, index| nb * index}

numbers.each do |nb|
  puts "Hello " * nb
end

numbers.map do |nb|
  nb * 3
end

#Yield will pass your custom block << is equivalent of push (can also use .push) 
def custom_map(list)
  outputArr = []
  list.each {|n| outputArr.push yield n }

end

custom_map(numbers) {|n| n * 3}

def custom_map(list, &block)
  outputArr = []
  list.each do |n|
    outputArr.push.block.call n
  end
end


numbers = [6, 9, 4, 2, 6, 5, 8, 3]
numbers.each_with_index {|n, index| puts index}

scrabble_words = ["QUARTZY", "OXAZEPAM", "QUIZZIFY", "OXPHENBUTAZONE", "QUIXOTRY"]

scrabble_words.each_with_index {|word, index| puts "#{index +1}= Length of #{word} is #{word.length}" }

#Hash

famous_painter = {
  first_name: "Pablo",
  last_name: "Picasso",
  date_of_birth: 1881,
  date_of_death: 1973
}

famous_painter.each do |key, value|
  puts "#{key} #{value}"
end

famous_painters = {
  {
    first_name: "Pablo",
    last_name: "Picasso",
    date_of_birth: 1881,
    date_of_death: 1973
  },
  {
    first_name: "Another dude",
    last_name: "Dude",
    
  }
}

famous_painters.each do |painterHash, index|
  puts index+1

  painterHash.each do |key, value|
    puts "#{key} #{value}"
  end
end
