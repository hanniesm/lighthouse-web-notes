#Active Record

Gemfile is the equivalent of package.JSON

Group development/test kind of like the dependencies in package.JSON

Bundle install rather than npm install

##setup gem
setup.rb
bundle init will create new gem file. 

````ruby
source "https://rubygems.org"

gem 'activerecord'
gem 'pry'
gem 'pg'
gem 'faker'

````
run bundle install to go through file and install what is needed, including dependencies. Bundle show will show you all the versions that have been installed. It will also create a Gemfile.lock which is equivalent of package.JSON.lock
You don't see a folder called gem. It won't install locally in this project. Like you're doing npm -g all the time. 

Rvm ls will show you all the ruby versions installed on machine. rvm [version #] will change the version of Ruby you're using. The gems are dependent on the Ruby version you're using, so you'dneed to bundle install again. 

Bundle show [name of Gem] will show you where the gem installed.

##active record vs Knex
is a library used in Rails. Can be used on its own but designed for rails. Used to interact with the database. Equivalent of Knex. Knex made it easier to deal with database in Javascript app. Active Record provide you with migrations, way to see your data, interact with data using Ruby. 
Active Record goes beyond what Knex does. Active Record transforms database into Object related model.
Active Record is an ORM - Object Relational Mapper. Define a class to interact with database. Each row in table will be an object. One class per table in database. Classes are called models. Each column will be a property of that object/class.
Active Record will return you a collection of objects. You add data like you're populating a hash.
