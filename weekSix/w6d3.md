#Websocket
HTTP wasn't built for real-time, full-duplex communication. Online games - need to know at every moment where the adversaries are, where the treasures are. Etc.

In chat application 1 server, 3 clients. One clients sends a message/request to the server. HTTP can't send it to the other clients without them doing a request. Can achieve it through polling - constantly sending a request to see if something has changed. 

That's why need something like websocket. 

Websocket is not an entirely new protocol, it's built on top of HTTP. 

HTTP was a client-server model. Websocket is two-way. Server is not just waiting for something. It can act upon it. 

Library socket.io

Four events
1) onopen when connection is established. 
<!-- Note later there seems to also be onconnection. Onopen is on the client. Onconnection is on the server. -->
2) onmessage when receiving a message
3) onerror when an error occurs
4) onclose when disconnects

Going to create a websocket server and client.
Chat client 
Ws_server

This is an express setup.

require 'ws'
```javascript
<!-- //server is an instance of  -->
const server = app.list(PORT, () => ...)
const wss = newSocketServer.Server({ server })

<!-- //This is the client that will connect to the server. On close is paart of on connection -->
wss.on('connection', ws => {
    console.log('client connected.')

    ws.on('close', ()=> console.log('client disconnected'))
})

//Terminal start server and start client. Right now client is not connecting to the server. Need both ends to have an onconnection. Right now has username Anonymous. Want server to send the username and status to change to be online-->

//App.js


const handleOnOpen = event => {
    console.log('client connected');
}

const handleOnError = event => {
    console.log('Error connecting to websocket')
}

class App extends Component {
    componentDidMount() {
        const socketURL = 'ws://localhost:3001';

        this.socket = new WebSocket(socketUrl)

        this.socket.onopen = handleOnOpen;

        this.socket.onerror = handleOnError;
    }
}

// Back on the server

const connectClient = (client, nbClients) => {
    
    // Going to build an object that will be sent back to client. Maybe it's a notification/maybe it's client information. In this case want to send back a username which injects the name of clients connected.

    const infoMsg = {
        username: `Anonymous${nbClients}`
        type:'incomingClientInfo',
    };
// On client need to capture this message.
    client.send(JSON.stringify(infoMsg));
    
}

// sending websocket and the number of clients that are connected.

wss.on('connection', ws => {
    connectClient(ws, wss.clients.size);

    console.log('client connected.')
})

//Back to the client. Now a message has been sent we will use onMessage




class App extends Component {
// Note moved this into the class

    handleOnOpen = event => {
        console.log('client connected');
    }

    handleOnError = event => {
        console.log('Error connecting to websocket')
    }

// as we stringified it when we sent it need to parse it 
    handleOnMessage = event => {
        const incomingMessage = JSON.parse(event.data)

// Currently only have one type, but we might have more types down the road so want to do a switch
        switch(incomingMessage.type) {
            case 'incomingClientInfo': 
                console.log(incomingMessage);
            break;

            default: 
                console.log('Unknown type of message')
        }
    }
    
    componentDidMount() {
        const socketURL = 'ws://localhost:3001';

        this.socket = new WebSocket(socketUrl)

        this.socket.onopen = this.handleOnOpen;

        this.socket.onmessage = this.handleOnMessage;

        this.socket.onerror = this.handleOnError;
    }
}
// Now receive a message from the server on the client. Now need to take this information and update in chat. To do this need to set state

class App extends Component {

    constructor(props) {
       super(props)
       this.state = {
           currentUser: {
               id: '0',
               username: '',
               color: 'black'
           }
       }
    }

    handleOnOpen = event => {
        console.log('client connected');
    }

    handleOnError = event => {
        console.log('Error connecting to websocket')
    }

    handleOnMessage = event => {
        const incomingMessage = JSON.parse(event.data)

        switch(incomingMessage.type) {
            case 'incomingClientInfo': 
                const {username} = incomingMessage
                // Need to respect the structure of the setstate, at moment recreating the object with values as below. Need to keep what was there below.
                // this.setState({currentUser: {username: username } });
                //this spreads out the current content in the state object and then only overrides the username
                this.setState({currentUser: {... this.state.currentUser, username: username } });
                // Now need to pass it down to render
            break;

            default: 
                console.log('Unknown type of message')
        }
    }
    
    componentDidMount() {
        const socketURL = 'ws://localhost:3001';

        this.socket = new WebSocket(socketUrl)

        this.socket.onopen = this.handleOnOpen;

        this.socket.onmessage = this.handleOnMessage;

        this.socket.onerror = this.handleOnError;
    
    }

    render() {
        return <Headernav
    }
}
