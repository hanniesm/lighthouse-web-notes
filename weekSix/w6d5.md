#Object Oriented Programming

##Object constructors
Writing a constructor object then need to use this

```javascript
function WaterBottle() {
    this.volume = 1000,
    this.carbonated = true,
    this.type = 'plastic',
    this.fillPercentage = 70,

    this.refill = function(amount) {
        this.fillPercentage += amount
    },

    this.drink = function(amount) {
        this.fillPercentage -= amount
    }
}

// or if don't want to hard code the properties
function WaterBottle(volume, carbonated, type, fillPercentage) {
    this.volume = volume,
    this.carbonated = carbonated,
    this.type = type,
    this.fillPercentage = fillPercentage,

    this.refill = function(amount) {
        this.fillPercentage += amount
    },

    this.drink = function(amount) {
        this.fillPercentage -= amount
    }
}

```
You can't modify the methods inside objects. You have to use prototypes
##Prototypes
You need to create the functions as prototypes and then alter the original prototype in order for the changes to stick.

##Classes
class WaterBottle {
    constructor(volume, carbonated, type, fillPercentage) {
        this.volume = volume,
        this.carbonated = carbonated,
        this.type = type,
        this.fillPercentage = fillPercentage,
    }
}

###Setters and Getters
Way of understanding whether we are fetching or establishing something in our code. Not strictly necessary, but help when have a lot of objects/classes to understand what is going on. Also means that methods will be available as prototypes without having to say prototype.

Could make a getter method that gets the value and transforms it into a nice string.

```javascript
class WaterBottle {
    constructor(volume, carbonated, type, fillPercentage) {
        this.volume = volume,
        this.carbonated = carbonated,
        this.type = type,
        this.fillPercentage = fillPercentage,
    }
    set refill(amount) {

    }
}
// if want to make a new class that uses the properties of the WaterBottle then need to extend.
class VirgilsWaterBottle extends WaterBottle {
    constructor() {
        super(WaterBottle)
        this.color = 'green'
    }
}
