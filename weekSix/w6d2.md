#Continuing with React

<!-- Need to get quotes from the backend. First need to get response as a JSON then at moment we'll console log the quotes, then we'll set the state. Request should be on same server or will get a CORS error. React frontend runs on a different server than the backend - can be completely decoupled -->
componentDidMount() {
  fetch('/quotes')
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(quotes => this.setState({ quotes }));
}
<!-- Need to add a proxy in the package.json. Request goes out but it's going to act like it's on 3000 -->

"proxy": "http://localhost:8000"

<!-- Need to restart webserver if change package.json  -->

<!-- as app it is top level so no props -->
render()
...
<QuoteList quotes={ this.state.quotes } />

<!-- Then in React dev tools will see that QuoteList has the Quotes in the props -->

<!-- In QuoteList.js -->

import React from 'react';

class QuoteList extends Component {
  constructor ()
}

<!-- instead can write as a function, because it doesn't have a state of its own. So don't need a class. Stateless functional component -->

const QuoteList = props => {

<!-- Can write like this -->

  const quotelist = props.quotes.map(quote => <Quote />);

<!-- or this -->

  const QuoteList = ({ quotes}) => {
  const quotelist = (quotes.map(quote) => (
    <Quote key={quote._id} id={quote._id} content={quote.quote} comment={quote.comment}/>
    ));

    return (
      <div className="accordion" id="quote-list">
          {quotelist}
      </div>
    );
  }
]
export default QuoteList;

<!-- In Quote -->

const Quote = ({ id, content }) => {

}


##Takeaway
1) Get data in state
2) Pass all the data down to children in props

##Add new quote
As React is rendering everything on client side. Form needs to also be rendered on the client side. Client side routing may do in final project.

import React from 'react'

const AddQuote = props => {
  return (
<!-- Add from HTML need to change class to className and style needs to be wrapped in object -->
  )
}

Button is a child component. Data can't flow up from child. Need to do a function.

const submitQuote = event => {
  event.preventDefault();
  const quoteContent = event.target.elements.quote.value;

  props.addNewQuote(quoteContent);
}

<form onSubmit={submitQuote}>
  ...
</form>

in app need to define function
addNewQuote = content => {
  <!-- create post request to backend -->

  const data = {
    quote: content
}

  fetch('/quotes', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify(data),
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
  }
 })
  .then(result => result.json())
  .then(quote => this.setState({ quotes: [...this.state.quotes, quote] }))
  .then(() => this.setState({addQuote: false }))

  <!-- Receive new quote from backend and update the state -->

}

In addQuote need to add the function

{this.state.addQuote ? (
  <AddQuote addNewQuote={this.addNewQuote} />
  ) : null }
