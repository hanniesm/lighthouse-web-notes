#User Authentication
Cookies used for user persistence.
Sessions are encrypted.

Login, logout and registration pages
Store users and passwords in a database

Bcrypt passwords.

API key kept in environment file.

API_KEY = blahblahblah
then refer to this key in project.
Add env file to gitignore.

Create a middleware function that will be used everytime a request is made.

var myLogger = function (req, res, next) {
  console.log("Logged")
  next()
}
If don't have next () then it will stop at this point and not go to routes.

let redirectIfNoCookie = function(req, res, next) {
  if(req.session.user){
    console.log("user has a cookie")
    next()
  }
  else if (req.path !== "/login") {
    console.log("User doesn\'t have a cookie")
    res.redirect('/login')
  }
  else {
    console.log("User doesn't have a cookie and is on the login page")
  }
}

app.use(redirectIfNoCookie)


Passport.js middleware for authorization.
OAuth3Strategy

Dont want to do authentication in front end or everyone will have access to the secret variables.

Need to use promises - passport.js does this for you.
